# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot. This module focuses on ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots, covering core communication concepts and humanoid description.

## Learning Path

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters that build upon each other:

### [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Basics](./ros2-basics)
Learn fundamental ROS 2 concepts, its importance for humanoid robotics, and DDS principles. This chapter provides the foundational knowledge needed for the rest of the module.

### [Chapter 2: Nodes/Topics/Services](./nodes-topics-services)
Explore the core communication patterns in ROS 2, including practical examples using rclpy and agent ↔ controller flow patterns essential for humanoid robotics.

### [Chapter 3: URDF & Python–ROS Integration](./urdf-python-ros-integration)
Understand URDF for humanoid robots and how to integrate it with Python-based ROS systems, including simulation readiness requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (preferably in Python)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer with internet connection

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 and its relevance to humanoid robotics
- Implement basic communication patterns using Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Create and work with URDF models for humanoid robots
- Integrate Python-based systems with ROS and URDF models

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous one, but can also be read independently for reference.
