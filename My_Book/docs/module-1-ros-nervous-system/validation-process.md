# Content Validation Process

## Purpose
This document outlines the validation process to ensure all content meets the "source-grounded content" principle from the project constitution.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Source Verification
- [ ] All technical claims are verified against official ROS 2 documentation
- [ ] All examples have been tested and confirmed to work as described
- [ ] Any external sources are properly cited and attributed
- [ ] No speculative or hypothetical content is included

### 2. Constitution Compliance Check
- [ ] Content adheres to "Zero Hallucination Tolerance" principle
- [ ] All information can be traced to authoritative sources
- [ ] Content is appropriate for target audience (AI/software students)
- [ ] Terminology is consistent with official ROS 2 documentation

### 3. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Content follows established formatting guidelines
- [ ] Code examples are properly formatted and executable
- [ ] All links are valid and point to correct resources
- [ ] Content is accessible to students with varying technical backgrounds

## Validation Checklist
