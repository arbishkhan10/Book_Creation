# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot. This module focuses on digital twin simulation using Gazebo and Unity for humanoid environments, covering physics simulation, digital twins and HRI, and sensor simulation.

## Learning Path

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters that build upon each other:

### [Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo)
Learn how to create physics-based simulations using Gazebo for humanoid environments, including model setup, physics properties, and environment interaction.

### [Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI in Unity](./digital-twins-hri-unity)
Explore creating high-fidelity digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) using Unity, enabling visualization and interaction with simulated humanoid environments.

### [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation](./sensor-simulation-validation)
Discover how to simulate sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) and validate sensor data for humanoid robots in simulated environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer with internet connection

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up physics simulations in Gazebo for humanoid environments
- Create high-fidelity digital twins using Unity
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) and validate their outputs
- Integrate simulation components for comprehensive humanoid robot simulation

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous one, but can also be read independently for reference.
