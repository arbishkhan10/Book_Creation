# Content Validation Process for Simulation Technologies

## Purpose
This document outlines the validation process to ensure all content meets the "source-grounded content" principle from the project constitution, specifically for simulation technologies (Gazebo, Unity, sensors).

## Validation Steps

### 1. Source Verification
- [ ] All technical claims are verified against official Gazebo, Unity, or sensor documentation
- [ ] All examples have been tested and confirmed to work as described
- [ ] Any external sources are properly cited and attributed
- [ ] No speculative or hypothetical content is included

### 2. Simulation-Specific Validation
- [ ] Gazebo examples are validated with official Gazebo documentation and tested in appropriate version
- [ ] Unity examples are validated with official Unity documentation and tested in appropriate version
- [ ] Sensor simulation examples include realistic parameters based on actual sensor specifications
- [ ] All simulation workflows are technically feasible and reproducible

### 3. Constitution Compliance Check
- [ ] Content adheres to "Zero Hallucination Tolerance" principle
- [ ] All information can be traced to authoritative sources
- [ ] Content is appropriate for target audience (AI/robotics students)
- [ ] Terminology is consistent with official documentation

### 4. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Content follows established formatting guidelines
- [ ] Code examples and configurations are properly formatted and executable
- [ ] All links are valid and point to correct resources
- [ ] Content is accessible to students with varying technical backgrounds

## Validation Checklist

Before publishing any content, ensure all of the following are true:

- [ ] All information is sourced from official Gazebo, Unity, or sensor documentation
- [ ] Examples have been tested in relevant simulation environments
- [ ] All external resources are properly cited
- [ ] Content does not contain any speculative or hypothetical information
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout the module
- [ ] Content follows the established chapter template
- [ ] All code/configurations are properly formatted and include explanations
- [ ] Simulation workflows are technically accurate and feasible

## Review Process

1. Author completes initial content creation
2. Author performs self-validation using the checklist above
3. Peer review by another team member with simulation expertise
4. Final verification against official documentation
5. Approval for publication

## Documentation Requirements

All content must include:
- Clear citations to official Gazebo, Unity, or sensor documentation
- Version information for simulation software where applicable
- Attribution for any external resources used
- Disclaimers for any content that is educational interpretation rather than official documentation
- Validation notes confirming examples have been tested in simulation environments
