# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Humanoid Robotics Book, focusing on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) integration. This module covers the integration of voice recognition, visual perception, and cognitive planning to create intelligent robotic systems that can understand and respond to natural language commands while perceiving their environment.

## Overview

This module explores the cutting-edge integration of Vision-Language-Action systems in robotics, focusing on:

- **Voice-to-Action Systems**: Using OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition and natural language processing
- **Vision-Language Planning**: Combining computer vision with LLMs for cognitive planning in ROS 2
- **Autonomous Humanoid Integration**: Complete integration of all VLA components into a functional humanoid robot system
