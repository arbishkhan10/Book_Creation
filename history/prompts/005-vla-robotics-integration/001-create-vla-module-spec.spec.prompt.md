# Create VLA Module Specification

## Prompt Text

```
Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Audience:
- AI and robotics students building autonomous humanoid systems

Focus:
- LLM + robotics integration
- Voice-driven control and cognitive planning

Chapters (Docusaurus):
- Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action
- Chapter 2: Vision-Language Planning
- Chapter 3: Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive specification for Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) including:
- Three prioritized user stories covering voice-to-action, vision-language planning, and capstone autonomous humanoid
- Functional requirements for educational content delivery
- Key entities definition for VLA systems
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Edge cases for ambiguous commands and conflicting inputs
- Quality checklist validation

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete specification for the VLA module that is ready for planning phase. The specification covers all required aspects including user scenarios, functional requirements, and measurable success criteria while maintaining technology-agnostic language appropriate for educational content.
