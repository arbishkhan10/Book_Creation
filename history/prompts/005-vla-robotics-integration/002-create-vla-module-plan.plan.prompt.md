# Create VLA Module Plan

## Prompt Text

```
Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

  - Initialize Module 4 in the existing Docusaurus project.

  - Create 3  chapters as .md files:

    - 1: Voice-to-Action With OpenAI Whisper
    - 2: Vision-Language Planning using LLMs for ROS 2
    - 3: Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid and documented

- Ensure all expamples are rennable and documented
- Complete within 2 weeks
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) including:

- Updated plan.md with technical context, project structure, and architecture decisions
- Created research.md with key technology decisions (OpenAI Whisper, LLMs, ROS 2 integration)
- Created data-model.md defining core entities for VLA systems
- Created quickstart.md with getting started guide and learning objectives
- Created placeholder contracts directory and file
- Updated agent context with new technologies (Markdown, Python, ROS 2, Docusaurus, OpenAI Whisper, LLMs)

The plan addresses all user requirements including the specific technologies (OpenAI Whisper), integration with ROS 2, and the 3 required chapters. All examples will be documented to be runnable as specified.

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete implementation plan for the VLA module that addresses all user requirements. The plan includes research on key technologies, data models for the educational content, quickstart guide, and proper integration with the existing Docusaurus documentation framework. The agent context has been updated with the new technologies used in this module.
