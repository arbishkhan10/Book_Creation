# Create VLA Module Tasks

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive task list for Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with 52 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks) - Initialize Docusaurus project structure
- Phase 2: Foundational Tasks (5 tasks) - Establish documentation guidelines
- Phase 3: [US1] Voice-to-Action With OpenAI Whisper (11 tasks) - Complete chapter on voice recognition
- Phase 4: [US2] Vision-Language Planning using LLMs for ROS 2 (11 tasks) - Complete chapter on vision-language planning
- Phase 5: [US3] Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid (11 tasks) - Complete integration capstone
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (10 tasks) - Final validation and integration

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, user story labels, and file paths. The tasks are organized to support parallel execution where possible and maintain independence between user stories.

## Outcome

Successfully generated executable tasks for implementing the VLA module documentation. Each task is specific enough to be completed independently and includes proper file paths and requirements. The task structure supports the 2-week timeline with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.
