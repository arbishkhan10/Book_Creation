# Module 3 Planning Process

## User Input

```
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

 - Set up Module-3 In Docusaurus with structure chapters.
 - Create 3 chapters as .md files:
     1. NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
     2. Isaac  ROS For VSLAM and navigation
     3. Nav2 path planning for humanoid robots
```

## Response Summary

The planning command was executed for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac). However, the implementation of this module has already been completed successfully with:

- Three comprehensive chapters created:
  1. `nvidia-isaac-sim.md` - Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data
  2. `isaac-ros-vslam-navigation.md` - Isaac ROS: Accelerated perception, VSLAM and Navigation
  3. `nav2-path-planning-humanoid.md` - Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation Path Planning and Movement

- All content properly integrated into the Docusaurus documentation site
- Sidebar configuration updated to include all chapters
- Cross-references and integration between chapters established
- Content meets all specifications for AI and robotics students

The planning process is being documented as a Prompt History Record, but the actual implementation work has already been completed successfully.

## Outcome

Planning process documented. Module 3 implementation is complete and ready for use.
