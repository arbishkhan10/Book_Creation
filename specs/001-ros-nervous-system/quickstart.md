# Quickstart: Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This quickstart guide will help you get started with the ROS 2 educational module. The module consists of three chapters covering ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer with internet connection

## Getting Started with the Module

### 1. Chapter Structure
The module contains three comprehensive chapters:
1. **ROS 2 Basics**: Learn what ROS 2 is, why it matters for humanoids, and DDS concepts
2. **Nodes/Topics/Services**: Understand Nodes, Topics, Services, and basic rclpy-based agent ↔ controller flow
3. **URDF & Python–ROS Integration**: Explore URDF for humanoid robots and Python-ROS integration

Each chapter includes learning objectives, hands-on exercises, examples with code snippets, summaries, additional resources, and references to official ROS 2 documentation.

### 2. Learning Path
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamentals of ROS 2
2. Proceed to Chapter 2 to learn about communication patterns
3. Complete Chapter 3 to understand robot description and simulation

### 3. Practical Exercises
Each chapter includes practical examples using rclpy (Python ROS client library) that you can follow along with. The examples demonstrate real-world applications of the concepts discussed.

### 4. Additional Resources
- Official ROS 2 documentation: https://docs.ros.org/
- ROS 2 tutorials: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html
- Docusaurus documentation: https://docusaurus.io/

## Technical Setup (for practical examples)
If you want to run the practical examples:
1. Install ROS 2 (recommended: latest stable version)
2. Set up your ROS 2 workspace
3. Install required dependencies as specified in each chapter

## Navigation
Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous one, but can also be read independently for reference.
