# Quickstart: Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
This quickstart guide will help you get started with the Digital Twin simulation educational module. The module consists of three chapters covering physics simulation with Gazebo, digital twins and HRI with Unity, and sensor simulation and validation.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer with internet connection

## Getting Started with the Module

### 1. Chapter Structure
The module contains three comprehensive chapters:
1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Learn how to create physics-based simulations for humanoid environments
2. **Digital Twins & HRI in Unity**: Create high-fidelity digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction interfaces
3. **Sensor Simulation & Validation**: Simulate sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) and validate sensor data

### 2. Learning Path
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand physics simulation fundamentals
2. Proceed to Chapter 2 to learn about digital twin visualization and interaction
3. Complete Chapter 3 to understand sensor simulation for perception systems

### 3. Practical Exercises
Each chapter includes practical examples using Gazebo and Unity that you can follow along with. The examples demonstrate real-world applications of the simulation concepts discussed.

### 4. Additional Resources
- Official Gazebo documentation: http://gazebosim.org/
- Unity documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/
- Docusaurus documentation: https://docusaurus.io/

## Technical Setup (for practical examples)
If you want to run the practical examples:
1. Install Gazebo (recommended: Garden or Fortress)
2. Install Unity (recommended: latest LTS version)
3. Install required dependencies as specified in each chapter

## Navigation
Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous one, but can also be read independently for reference.
