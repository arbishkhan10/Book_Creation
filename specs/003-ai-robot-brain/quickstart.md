# Quickstart: Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview
This quickstart guide will help you get started with the AI-Robot Brain educational module using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. The module consists of three chapters covering Isaac Sim for simulation, Isaac ROS for perception and navigation, and Nav2 for path planning.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer with internet connection

## Getting Started with the Module

### 1. Chapter Structure
The module contains three comprehensive chapters:
1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim for Photorealistic Simulation**: Learn how to use Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. **Isaac ROS for VSLAM and Navigation**: Implement accelerated perception, VSLAM, and navigation using Isaac ROS
3. **Nav2 Path Planning for Humanoid Robots**: Develop sophisticated navigation path planning for humanoid robots

### 2. Learning Path
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand Isaac Sim and photorealistic simulation
2. Proceed to Chapter 2 to learn about Isaac ROS for perception and navigation
3. Complete Chapter 3 to understand Nav2 path planning for humanoid robots

### 3. Practical Exercises
Each chapter includes practical examples using Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 that you can follow along with. The examples demonstrate real-world applications of the perception, navigation, and AI-driven decision making concepts discussed.

### 4. Additional Resources
- Official NVIDIA Isaac Sim Documentation: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/
- Isaac ROS Documentation: https://isaac-ros.github.io/
- Nav2 Documentation: https://navigation.ros.org/
- Docusaurus Documentation: https://docusaurus.io/

## Technical Setup (for practical examples)
If you want to run the practical examples:
1. Install NVIDIA Isaac Sim (requires Omniverse access)
2. Set up Isaac ROS components
3. Install Nav2 navigation stack
4. Install required dependencies as specified in each chapter

## Navigation
Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous one, but can also be read independently for reference.

## Chapter Completion Information
All three chapters are now complete with comprehensive content:
- Chapter 1 covers Isaac Sim architecture, synthetic data generation, physics simulation, and rendering
- Chapter 2 covers Isaac ROS architecture, VSLAM implementation, navigation system integration, and practical examples
- Chapter 3 covers Nav2 architecture, humanoid-specific navigation challenges, path planning algorithms, and integration with perception systems
